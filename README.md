# Defence-against-Malware-Attacks-on-DNN
Strong defence mechanisms against malware assaults on deep neural networks (DNNs) are crucial for preventing cyber risks. DNNs can be protected from such attacks by using cutting-edge methods like adversarial training and anomaly detection. This project serves as an example of how these methods may be used to strengthen DNN security and protect users from online dangers.
